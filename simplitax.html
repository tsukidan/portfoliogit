        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the Simplitax project was to create a simple and
          interactive web-based calculator for generating receipts. The project
          brief was to create something from scratch that used HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript effectively to show my ability to make something both
          functional and visually appealing. The reason behind it was to provide
          a demonstration of web development fundamentals while creating
          something actually usable for users who want to calculate totals and
          sales tax in real time.

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the Simplitax project was to create a simple and
          interactive web-based calculator for generating receipts. The project
          brief was to create something from scratch that used HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript effectively to show my ability to make something both
          functional and visually appealing. The reason behind it was to provide
          a demonstration of web development fundamentals while creating
          something actually usable for users who want to calculate totals and
          sales tax in real time.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          I started by laying out the HTML structure to contain all the main
          elements like input fields, receipt display area, and button controls.
          Once that was done I moved to the CSS to make it look the part, I
          wanted it to look like a printed receipt on a wooden table. I added
          textures for the paper and wood backgrounds to give it a realistic
          feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I wrote the JavaScript logic to handle adding items,
          calculating the tax, and dynamically generating the receipt as the
          user adds more data. I focused on validating input properly so it
          would not break when users typed in bad data. I also made sure the
          layout worked well on mobile by using media queries.
        </p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          The outcome was a completely functional and polished receipt generator
          that runs directly in the browser. It calculates and displays all
          added items accurately including their sales tax, and presents them in
          a nicely formatted way. The work was completed and shows a clean
          example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration. While it was not
          made for a client, it represents my ability to deliver front end work
          that is both practical and styled professionally. The project can be
          viewed in full on my personal portfolio or GitHub page.
        </p>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>
          This work is similar to my other front end projects that focus on
          combining clean design with core logic. It does not reference another
          specific project directly but was inspired by simple receipt
          generators and POS systems you see in small businesses. My motivation
          came from wanting to make something easy to use and visually grounded
          in the feeling of a printed receipt. I wanted it to feel like a real
          terminal with an old school paper texture while still being modern.
