        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the MySwitchLife project was to create a personal
          dashboard for Nintendo Switch users where they can see their games,
          goals, activity, and friends all in one place. The project brief was
          to make a full stack website from scratch that looks like a Nintendo
          styled UI and actually works end to end. The reason behind it was to
          provide a clean organized way to track play history and organize a
          game library instead of random spreadsheets or notes. It is my biggest
          project since and I wanted to show I can handle both the front end and
          the back end parts together.

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the MySwitchLife project was to create a personal
          dashboard for Nintendo Switch users where they can see their games,
          goals, activity, and friends all in one place. The project brief was
          to make a full stack website from scratch that looks like a Nintendo
          styled UI and actually works end to end. The reason behind it was to
          provide a clean organized way to track play history and organize a
          game library instead of random spreadsheets or notes. It is my biggest
          project since and I wanted to show I can handle both the front end and
          the back end parts together.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          I started with the server using Node.js and Express, connected to
          MongoDB, and set up a collection called library for saving games. I
          implemented routes for the library like GET and POST and DELETE on
          /api/games so users can load, save, and remove entries. For game data
          I added a Twitch OAuth flow to fetch an access token and then used the
          IGDB API to pull Nintendo Switch titles using a custom query that
          filters by platform 130 and excludes unwanted ratings. I created
          endpoints like /api/all-games for a big list and /api/recent-games for
          a smaller subset, which the front end can request.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mounted a goals handler on /api/goals so I can add, delete, and
          toggle goals per game, and then I render them grouped by game id. On
          the front end I built three main pages using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. The index dashboard has Recent Activity, Your Game
          Library, Achievements and Goals, and Friend Activity. Recent activity
          sorts by last_played and shows cards with the cover, name, and days
          ago text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library is a responsive grid with hover effects and a View All
          link to a full library page. Goals has a game selector and an Add
          button which opens a small modal to create a new goal; goals render as
          editable list items with checkboxes and a remove button. Friends is a
          simple feed with avatars and a short line of what they played. I used
          VanillaTilt for subtle 3D hover on covers and created reusable styles
          like the red section headers and rounded panels. The UI is responsive
          with grid layout switching to one column on mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also built a modal for game details with a canvas area and a right
          side description, plus a smaller modal for picking the last played
          date. All of this ties into the server endpoints so the dashboard can
          fetch /api/games and /api/goals on load, then paint the UI
          dynamically.
        </p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          The outcome was a working full stack web dashboard that feels like a
          real app. It pulls curated Nintendo game data from IGDB using a server
          proxy, saves a personal library into MongoDB, and manages per game
          goals that can be added, edited, checked off, or removed. The
          dashboard loads recent activity automatically based on last_played and
          shows a clean grid of the entire library. It also includes a friend
          activity section and a user settings page to round it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          While not a client delivery, it met my scope for functionality and
          design, and it proves I can integrate external APIs, database storage,
          and a responsive front end together in one project. The project can be
          viewed in full on my portfolio or GitHub when requested.
        </p>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>
          This work is similar to other dashboards and trackers I have built for
          myself, but this time focused on Nintendo Switch specifically. It
          references modern web dashboards and some Nintendo themed UI
          inspiration, like the red color and rounded panels, but everything was
          made by me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was motivated by the idea of having a simple home page that says
          Welcome and then shows recent play, a library grid, a goals checklist,
          and a friend feed without having to dig through menus. I also wanted
          to use real data patterns, like saving games to a database and pulling
          game info from an external API, not just hard coded items.
