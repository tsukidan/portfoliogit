        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the Supply Post E-Commerce website was to create a
          clean and organized storefront where users can shop for their favorite
          outdoor gear. The project brief was to create the website for the
          company, including logo and everything. The reason behind it was to
          provide a cohesive high quality website for an ecommerce website.

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the Supply Post E-Commerce website was to create a
          clean and organized storefront where users can shop for their favorite
          outdoor gear. The project brief was to create the website for the
          company, including logo and everything. The reason behind it was to
          provide a cohesive high quality website for an ecommerce website.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          I was the one maintaining GitHub control, version control, as well as
          creating the landing page and home page for the website. I was a key
          component for making the landing page become accessible and functional
          for all the other web pages on the site as well. I was able to begin
          by looking at what I did in the past, looking at what I learned and
          what I could take from it as well as understanding that a website is
          different from a C++ program, and translating the successes
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to that, we had a team for the UX so I decided to work on
          the back end codebase as the web development team member. With all of
          this in mind, I was able to incorporate the front end design fairly
          quickly due to my focus on the back end and version control being
          maintained while awaiting deliverables from the UX team.
        </p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          The outcome of the work was complicated. Due to the time restraints,
          and being the last in the chain to receive deliverables from previous
          teams, it was difficult creating a final product. While we have done
          everything in order to facilitate the incoming material easily, it was
          clear that we simply did not have enough material to work off of. I
          believe that we were able to create something that is still
          professional, accessible and creative.
        </p>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>
          This work was similar to another C++ project of mine called the Bulk
          Club Project. It was intended to create a membership program software
          for a company to use for their membership management. It is not
          exactly an e-commerce site but a lot of overlap in logic was clearly
          present. My prior knowledge motivated me to take what I learned into
          the E-Commerce Project.
